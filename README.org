* =go-livereload-bootstrap=

This is a repository that is designed to work with the tool [[https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew][gonew]].
** Tooling Bootstrap
First install the following tools:
#+begin_src sh
  # setup go normally
  go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew@latest
  go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
#+end_src

This provides the ability to template a new project from this one on the local system as well as the designated task runner. These are installed separately.
** New Module Initialization
The goal is to do the following:

#+begin_src sh
  NEW_PROJECT="new-project"
  gonew github.com/xemdetia/go-livereload-bootstrap $NEW_PROJECT
  cd $NEW_PROJECT
  task build
  task air
#+end_src
